### Service Swagger Specifications

When deployed, each service provides a Swagger UI for exploring its API. The Swagger UI is available at the `/swagger` endpoint for most of the services. For example, the Swagger UI for the **Account** service is available at `https://link-account/swagger`. However, the endpoint for swagger specifications varies between .NET and Java.

* .NET Services
  * UI: `/swagger`
  * JSON: `/swagger/v1/swagger.json`
* Java Services
  * UI: `/swagger-ui.html`
  * JSON: `/v3/api-docs`
